# Extract racecards from racingpost.co.uk
## as it was in 2002â€¦
In 2002 I cobbled together a small shell script to retrieve, parse and archive
race cards from racingpost.co.uk locally. The data was not officially
republished and only used by me and a friend of mine who used the data to
place his bets and update his personal files on races.

I didn't put much effort in creating a beautiful, highly configurable webscraper, but rather used the bare basics of a simple shell script to get the thing up
and running. From start to finish it took me one evening and the script,
despite its simplicity, proofed to work rather well for a long time to come.
